## Add else and elseif branches to if blocks

`if` blocks now support `else` and `elseif` branches, so you no longer need to duplicate content with negated conditions.

```pony
let t = Template.parse(
  "{{ if admin }}admin panel" +
  "{{ elseif member }}member area" +
  "{{ else }}public page{{ end }}")?
```

`elseif` chains can be as long as needed. A final `else` branch is optional and renders when no condition matches.

## Add `ifnot` negated conditional blocks

`ifnot` renders its body when a variable is absent — the logical inverse of `if`. This lets you write the "missing" case as the primary branch instead of requiring an `if`/`else` just to get at the `else`.

```pony
let t = Template.parse(
  "{{ ifnot name }}Anonymous{{ end }}")?
```

Like `if`, `ifnot` supports `else` and `elseif` branches:

```pony
let t = Template.parse(
  "{{ ifnot name }}Anonymous{{ else }}{{ name }}{{ end }}")?
```
